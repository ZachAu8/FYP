# Final Year Project 
In this project, I started by reviewing several commonc classification algorithms, and I trained three classifiers (i.e. XGBoost, SVM and LSTM) for binary classificaction on Hang Seng Index (HSI). 
The data used for model training was web-scraped, using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) or calculated by formulas (for technical indicators)
